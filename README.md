# Python PDF Tools
A few simple python scripts to make your life a little easier.

* Combine all PDF files in a directory using 'Combine.py'

* Verify all PDF files in a directory using 'Verify.py'

* Verify and move all non-verified PDF files into a seperate folder in a directory using 'VMove.py'

To use the tools, just download a single script or all of them, drop them in the directory and use CLI to run.

Originally used it to sort through a few thousand PDF files, took only a few seconds.
